Stabilize
=========

INSTALL
-------
Stabilize doesn't install (yet). stabilize.py (in src/) should run without installation
To run it, you will need:
	pyopencv
	NumPy
	and a Python Interpreter
	This all should be available on debian/ubuntu/linux mint etc, with the following command:
		sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-opencv

Usage
-----
	Stabilize takes several video formats - those supported by libavcodec, and outputs
	to an .avi file with XVID video. There isn't a way to input from images or output to
	different video formats (yet)
